## Running the Character Recognition Algorithm
 1. Configure your anaconda environment to include the following libraries (these libraries can also be found in the requirements.txt file): python (version 3.9.5), numpy (version 1.16.6), pytorch (version 1.11.0 with CUDA 11.3), torchvision (version 0.12.0), opencv (version 4.5.4), matplotlib (version 3.3.4), numpy (version 1.16.6), and tqdm (version 4.61.1).
 2. Find the image file you would like to run the algorithm on. Ensure that the image is a .jpg, .jpeg, or .png file and that each of the letters are within their respective 28-pixel by 28-pixel boxes.
 3. Using the image file path from the previous step, run the main.py file with the image file path as the first and only argument
